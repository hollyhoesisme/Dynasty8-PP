Property Listing - an open unclaimed contract that contains the details for one particular property
Property Title - a claimed contract that contains the details of the owner and the property.

Database: House-Listings.dbo which contains all house listings and is to be unedited
Need  to do a database join with the House-Listings.dbo and the Properties-Sold.dbo. That way we know which houses are sold or not.
Post-join, if the resulting database has a House Owner, it is sold. Button should be [Create Listing] and have a House Owner populated
Columns:
 date_submitted: today,
 property_address: '',
 property_price: null,
 property_description: '',
 property_area: '',
 property_gps_coordinates: coords,
 showSubmissible: false,
 isSubmissible: false,

Transfers: Transfers should do two DB edits: 
1) It should INSERT a transfer in Properties-Transferred.dbo from old/new ID, Home Owner. This is purely for history tracking.
2) It should UPDATE the Properties-Sold.dbo to update the Home Owner and House ID
